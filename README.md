# LCD-Times-In-Different-Cities
A TIVA-C Embedded system displaying times in different cities on an LCD with FreeRTOS.

the LCD first displays choices for the user on which city's time he would like to view.
using UART to select, the timein that city is displayed.

I created the LCD, and the UART Drivers in myDrivers file, the city_times file uses the drivers to complete its' tasks.
